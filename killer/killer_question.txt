You have access to multiple clusters from your main terminal through kubectl contexts. Write all those context names into /opt/course/1/contexts.
Next write a command to display the current context into /opt/course/1/context_default_kubectl.sh, the command should use kubectl.
Finally write a second command doing the same thing into /opt/course/1/context_default_no_kubectl.sh, but without the use of kubectl.

Do the following in Namespace default. Create a single Pod named ready-if-service-ready of image nginx:1.16.1-alpine. Configure a LivenessProbe which simply runs true. Also configure a ReadinessProbe which does check if the url http://service-am-i-ready:80 is reachable, you can use wget -T2 -O- http://service-am-i-ready:80 for this. Start the Pod and confirm it isn't ready because of the ReadinessProbe.

Create a second Pod named am-i-ready of image nginx:1.16.1-alpine with label id: cross-server-ready. The already existing Service service-am-i-ready should now have that second Pod as endpoint.

Now the first Pod should be in ready state, confirm that.

Write a second command into /opt/course/5/find_pods_uid.sh which lists all Pods sorted by field metadata.uid. Use kubectl sorting for both commands.

Create a new PersistentVolume named safari-pv. It should have a capacity of 2Gi, accessMode ReadWriteOnce, hostPath /Volumes/Data and no storageClassName defined.

Next create a new PersistentVolumeClaim in Namespace project-tiger named safari-pvc . It should request 2Gi storage, accessMode ReadWriteOnce and should not define a storageClassName. The PVC should bound to the PV correctly.

Finally create a new Deployment safari in Namespace project-tiger which mounts that volume at /tmp/safari-data. The Pods of that Deployment should be of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine.

Write your findings into file /opt/course/8/master-components.txt. The file should be structured like:

Ssh into the master node with ssh cluster2-master1. Temporarily stop the kube-scheduler, this means in a way that you can start it again afterwards.

Create a single Pod named manual-schedule of image httpd:2.4-alpine, confirm its created but not scheduled on any node.

Now you're the scheduler and have all its power, manually schedule that Pod on node cluster2-master1. Make sure it's running.

Start the kube-scheduler again and confirm its running correctly by creating a second Pod named manual-schedule2 of image httpd:2.4-alpine and check if it's running on cluster2-worker1.

Use Namespace project-tiger for the following. Create a DaemonSet named ds-important with image httpd:2.4-alpine and labels id=ds-important and uuid=18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462.

Use Namespace project-tiger for the following. Create a Deployment named deploy-important with label id=very-important (the Pods should also have this label) and 3 replicas. It should contain two containers, the first named container1 with image nginx:1.17.6-alpine and the second one named container2 with image kubernetes/pause.

There should be only ever one Pod of that Deployment running on one worker node. We have two worker nodes: cluster1-worker1 and cluster1-worker2. Because the Deployment has three replicas the result should be that on both nodes one Pod is running. The third Pod won't be scheduled, unless a new worker node will be added.

In a way we kind of simulate the behaviour of a DaemonSet here, but using a Deployment and a fixed number of replicas.

Create a Pod named multi-container-playground in Namespace default with three containers, named c1, c2 and c3. There should be a volume attached to that Pod and mounted into every container, but the volume shouldn't be persisted or shared with other Pods.
Container c1 should be of image nginx:1.17.6-alpine and have the name of the node where its Pod is running available as environment variable MY_NODE_NAME.
Container c2 should be of image busybox:1.31.1 and write the output of the date command every second in the shared volume into file date.log. You can use while true; do date >> /your/vol/path/date.log; sleep 1; done for this.
Container c3 should be of image busybox:1.31.1 and constantly send the content of file date.log from the shared volume to stdout. You can use tail -f /your/vol/path/date.log for this.
Check the logs of container c3 to confirm correct setup.

There was a security incident where an intruder was able to access the whole cluster from a single hacked backend Pod.
To prevent this create a NetworkPolicy called np-backend in Namespace project-snake. It should allow the backend-* Pods only to:
	•	connect to db1-* Pods on port 1111
	•	connect to db2-* Pods on port 2222
Use the app label of Pods in your policy.
After implementation, connections from backend-* Pods to vault-* Pods on port 3333 should for example no longer work.
